# Conclusion

This covers a most basic introduction to ROS2.
There are many more features and capabilities of ROS2 that we have not covered in this lab.

Some of the key features of ROS2 that we have not covered include:

- Launch files
- Services
- Actions
- Parameters
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Lifecycle nodes

ROS2 is an incredibly powerful tool for building complex robotics systems.
My main advice would be to start small and to slowly incorporate new features as they been needed.
As opposed to trying to implement everything at once.
