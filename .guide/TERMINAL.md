# Linux command line

The Linux command line is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer. 

These should be entered into the terminal window at the bottom (by default) of the Codespace window.

Press enter to execute the command.

Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- `echo`: Print a message to the terminal. Use to test that the terminal is working.
    ```sh
    echo "Hello world!"
    ```

- `cd`: Change the current directory.
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/directory
    ```

- `cd ..`: Move up one directory level.
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

- `ls`: List the contents of the current directory.
    ```sh
    ls
    ```

- `pwd`: Print the current working directory, if you are unsure what directory the terminal is currently in.
    ```sh
    pwd
    ```

- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
    ```sh
    mkdir new_directory
    ```

- `rm`: Remove a file or directory.
    ```sh
    rm filename
    ```
    To remove a directory and its contents, use the `-r` option:
    ```sh
    rm -r directory_name
    ```

These commands form the foundation of navigating and managing files in a Linux environment.
